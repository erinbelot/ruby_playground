*Ruby Drills*

Follow the instructions carefully. They will be repetitive and are not designed to be interesting, but rather build up ‘muscle memory’. *Each* line of code that you write, you *must* save the file and run the code. If there are *any* errors, you fix them then and there. If in doubt, puts out the structure you have made to make sure that it is what you hoped it was. I’m looking for accuracy - I want the instructions followed precisely. It will be your choice of class and variable names (etc), but the functioning and number of attributes called for are immutable. Ideally you’ll want the work to be checked, so copy and paste this text into a file and comment it out, so that I can check it easily - put the answer directly below the question.

1. Make a method that takes two arguments, and returns the result of them added together.
2. Call the above method four times with different inputs.
3. Define two integer and two float variables, and use them as arguments to this method you have made.
4. Make a hash with 4 keys, and have the keys be three different data types.
5. Define a class that has 3 attributes, and make one readable, and the other two writeable.
6. Make two instance methods in the class you defined that do something basic (anything you like).
7. Make 8 objects from the class you just made.
8. Puts out an attribute of four of the objects (instances of the class) that you made.
9. Assign some values to attributes of the objects you have made.
10. Define a function that takes a hash as the input, and puts out the value of one of the keys of the hash.
11. Make a hash with three keys and values, and assign it to a variable.
12. Make four more hashes with the same qualities.
13. Define a variable that will be assigned an empty array.
14. Define a function that takes an array and a hash as arguments. The function will push the hash into the array given.
15. Using the method, the four hashes, and the array that you have made in the previous steps, call the method four times to put four hashes into the array.
16. Make sure that the array contains four hashes (maybe puts).
17. Make an class that has six attributes and three instance methods.
18. Make two of the attributes readable, three writeable, and one both readable and writable.
19. Write two instance methods for the class you just made.
20. Make five objects from the class you made.
21. Puts the value of three separate object’s attributes.
22. Call the instance methods of three of these objects.
